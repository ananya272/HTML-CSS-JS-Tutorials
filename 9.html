<!-- An entity is a piece of text (“string”) that begins with an ‘&’ and ends with a ‘;’.
<div class= “container”>
    <p>This is a Paragraph</p>
</div>
<div class= “container”>
  <p>This is another Paragraph</p>
</div>
HTML treats all the extra spaces as a single space only and automatically removes all of them. Therefore, if you want to use extra spaces or any special characters, then you have to use HTML entities. To get extra space we can use &nbsp (non-breaking space) after that particular text. For example-

<div class= “container”>
          <p>This is another &nbsp Paragraph</p>
</div>
Entities are also used to write some special characters that you cannot write from keyboards and also those words that are reserved in HTML. For example, if we want <p> to appear in the result, then it is not possible without the help of entities. 

    <div class= “container”>
              <p>This is another Paragraph<p></p>
    </div>
    By writing the above code, we will see that we cannot obtain the <p> in our result. Therefore, the solution for this is we can take the help of HTML entities. We have to write in this format-

        <div class= “container”>
                  <p>This is another Paragraph &lt;p&gt; </p>
        </div> -->
