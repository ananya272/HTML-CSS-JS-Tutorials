<!-- The lists are basically of two types-

Ordered lists (ol)
<ol>

          <li>This is the first item of my unordered list</li>

</ol>
Unordered lists (ul)
<ul>

          <li>This is the first item if my unordered list</li>

</ul>
The difference between an ordered and an unordered list is that the ordered list displays the list in this format -

1.

2.

3.

….

On the other hand, the unordered lists display the list in the following format-

.
.
.
Both the lists have more than one attribute which we can write using the type command. For example, if we write:

<ol type= “I”>
 Then we will get the lists as I, II, III, and so on. In the same format, we can also get the lists as A, B, C, and so on.

This applies on unordered lists also. If we write

<ul type= “square”>
Then we will get a bulleted square instead of a circle. -->

<!-- A table is just a combination of rows and columns on a webpage. The structure of the table looks like-
The main part is the table tag, and it consists of two parts: the table head and table body. The <thead> consists of the main head of the table and <tbody> consists of the body of the table. 

    <tr> is used to justify that it is the part of a row. Inside the <tr> tag, we give the headings of a row under the <th> tag. 
        n a table, there are mostly two things to remember, the head and the body of a table. To add more rows to the table, we can simply add a <tr> tag and add any number of rows in a table.

            I believe you have understood clearly what the lists and tables are. Tables and lists are two primary components of a website that helps in making it more attractive.  -->
