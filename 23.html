<!-- Visibility property is used to hide or show an HTML element without changing the layout of the page.
The hidden element uses the space on the page because it is still there, but it is not visible to the user. -->
<!-- Difference Between display:none; and visibility:hidden; 
There is a minor difference between the display: none; and visibility:hidden; property of CSS. Let's understand this difference with the help of the boxes that we created earlier. -->
<!-- In the above image, you can clearly see that box2 is completely removed from the webpage, and there is no empty space left on the page. But, when we used the visibility: hidden property, the box2 element was still occupying the space.

display:none; - It completely removes an HTML tag from the web page like it was never there.
visibility:hidden;  - It makes the tag invisible but will not remove the element, and it will still occupy the space on the page.
Z-Index Property In CSS :
At the starting of this tutorial, we created four boxes of different colours. Now, try to answer this question: What if one box overlaps the other? Which box will be visible to the user? This is where z-index property comes into the picture. So, whenever HTML elements collapse with each other, then the element with smaller z-index value will be covered by the element with larger z-index value.

Note: Z-index does not work on static position value. It only works on the elements with position: relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky.  We are changing the positions of box1 and box2 by applying the CSS given below: 

Use the following CSS for box2 :

 #box2 {
            background-color: rebeccapurple;
            display: none;
        } -->
